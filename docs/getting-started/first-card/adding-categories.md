A card's categories are the kinds of actions its effects can perform, usually in the resolution of its activated effects. To enter the categories for "Scrap Scholar", you'll first need to identify what those actions are. Let's start with the first effect:

> _Once per turn: You can banish 1 card from your hand; destroy 1 other monster you control, and if you do, add 1 "Scrap" card from your Deck to your hand, except "Scrap Scholar"._

When this effect resolves, it destroys a monster and adds a card from the Deck to the hand (i.e., it "searches" a card). So its categories are `Destroy Monster` and `Search`.

Notice that we **do not include** `Banish`, because it's an action performed as a **cost** to activate the effect, not as part of the effect's resolution.

Now, let's proceed to the second effect:

> _If this card is destroyed by the effect of a "Scrap" card and sent to your GY: You can target 1 other "Scrap" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, then destroy 1 card you control, except "Scrap Scholar". You can only use this effect of "Scrap Scholar" once per turn._

When this effect resolves, it Special Summons a monster and destroys a card (which could be a monster, Spell, or Trap), so its categories are `Special Summon`, `Destroy Monster`, and `Destroy S/T`.

This gives you the the full list of categories you need to add:

- Destroy Monster
- Destroy S/T
- Search
- Special Summon
